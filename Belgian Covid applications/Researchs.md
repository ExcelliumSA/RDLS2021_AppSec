## Coronalert

The belgian Coronalert application is a copy of the german application Corona Warn App (CWA).
Developped originally by SAP (DE) and overseen by cyber security experts from german research institutes.

The App sends a push message to users if they have been exposed to a person diagnosed  with COVID-19 (at  least 15 minutes  within the  last 14 days).

âš  Some laboratories and public health offices aren't equipped with the digital infrastructure to send test results to the system.
People who have been tested by such laboratories won't be reported in Coronalert.
